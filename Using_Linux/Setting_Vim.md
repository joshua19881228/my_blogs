Using VIM is always a geek thing. However, it seems to be exausting to remember large numbers of commonds and shortcuts. Perhaps some really cool plugins can help alleviate the pain.

* First of all, a tool to manage the plugins is of need. [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) is a minimalist Vim plugin manager, which is very easy to setup and use.
* To automatically complete the code, a tool called [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe) is one of the most popular tools. And to use this tool for C-family languages, another tool [Bear](https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear) is needed. Both of these two projects have detailed document.
* A very useful website to find useful vim plugins is [Vim Awesome](http://vimawesome.com/).
* Another very attractive Swiss-Army-Knife like package is [SpaceVim](https://spacevim.org/). It is a community-driven vim distribution that seeks to provide layer feature, especially for neovim. It offers a variety of layers to choose from. to create a suitable vim development environment, you just need to select the required layers.
