This photo reflects my life. 

I just wanted to take a picture of the flowers at first. When I had a better look at this photo, it turned out to be very interesting that it happened to record an epitome of my life.

There are too books, one of which is about algorithms while the other one introducing how to sketch. I need to develop my own core ability to survive in this world with fierce competition. On the other hand, a hobby is needed to enjoy life, which can help me forget troubles for a while and look down to my own heart to be a better man. With those two, beautiful flowers bloom in my life.
