It's been less input to me recently so that less output from me. This month is really busy. It's time to keep up!

I think I am a single-thread processor. It's really hard for me to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. I'd become worried about another one if I'm working on one task, which means that I might mess up with the current one. I don't know whether anyone can do it better. Besides the single-thread thing, sometimes I become too anxious to having any mood to do anything, like keeping a diary, reading paper or picking up a habit. Maybe I'm too narrow-minded??
